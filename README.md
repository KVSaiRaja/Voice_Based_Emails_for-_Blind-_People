# Voice_Based_Emails_for_Blind_People
Welcome to the Voice-Based Email Service for Visually Impaired People. In this video, we'll demonstrate how to use this innovative email service that allows visually impaired individuals to interact with their emails using voice commands.
# Step-1: Authentication
The first step is to sign in with your Gmail account. The system guides you through the authentication process by asking you to speak your email address and app password( For some security issues we have to create a default app password in 2FA).
# Step-2: Choose the action from Main Menu
Once authenticated, you'll be presented with the main menu. Here, you have several options: compose an email, access your inbox, sent folder, starred folder, spam folder, trash folder, or logout.
